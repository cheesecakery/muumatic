# Muumatic

Muumatic (Music animatic) is a web app that interacts with the Spotify API to display interesting results about patterns between songs through the use of animation. In the animation, each song is represented as a particle with various factors like loudness, bpm, energy and intensity affecting the colour, speed and size of a particle. A user can search for a specific term, or see the results of a playlist displayed, or look for a specific artist - all helping to discover different patterns. As well as displaying the results in an animation, users can see a corresponding line graph to highlight the real numbers behind the animation and see the trends in the data more concretely.

I decided to make this web app as I wanted to experiment with analysing data in unorthodox ways, as well as exploring how communicating with APIs work. 

The animations themselves are developed in the Javascript framework p5. The website is displayed using Python and framework Flask as the backend.
